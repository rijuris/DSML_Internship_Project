## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and classifying customers based on their likelihood to accept marketing campaigns. The dataset contains diverse information about customers, including demographic details, purchasing history, and responses to various marketing campaigns. The primary goal is to understand customer segments and their responsiveness to campaigns.

## Data Understanding
The dataset includes information about customers, products, promotions, and purchasing channels. Key columns include customer ID, birth year, education level, marital status, income, and details about purchases and campaign responses. The data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for exploration and analysis.

## Data Preparation
Irrelevant columns are dropped, and data types are converted as needed. Duplicates and missing values are handled, and columns are renamed for clarity. Categorical values are transformed, and feature scaling is applied to prepare the data for clustering algorithms.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis covers demographic insights, customer behavior, campaign effectiveness, purchase channels, and spending patterns. Visualizations help understand distributions, relationships, and patterns within the data.

## Customer Segmentation
Two clustering methods, KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering, are employed for customer segmentation. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score. The resulting clusters are visualized using t-SNE and analyzed.

## Results and Interpretation
The KMeans clustering method is chosen based on the highest Silhouette Score. The identified customer clusters provide insights into distinct groups with similar behavior. The clusters can guide targeted marketing strategies and campaigns tailored to specific customer segments.

## Usage
- **Data Exploration:** Understand the dataset by exploring the Jupyter Notebook containing data loading, cleaning, and initial analysis.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Explore the clusters obtained through KMeans clustering. Understand the characteristics of each cluster and their relevance to business goals.
- **Campaign Analysis:** Investigate the effectiveness of different marketing campaigns for each customer cluster. Identify patterns and preferences in campaign acceptance.
- **Visualization:** Utilize visualizations to gain insights into customer behavior, demographic distributions, and spending patterns.
- **Machine Learning:** The notebook includes machine learning techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction for customer segmentation.
