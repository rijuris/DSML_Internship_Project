Overview
This project focuses on customer behavior analysis and segmentation for campaign acceptance. The goal is to help a company understand and classify customer responses to marketing campaigns and create targeted marketing strategies.

Data Understanding
The dataset contains diverse customer information, including demographic details, purchase history, and campaign responses. Key columns include customer ID, birth year, education level, marital status, income, and campaign details. The data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

Data Preparation
Irrelevant columns are removed, data types are converted, and missing values are handled. Categorical values are transformed, and feature scaling is applied for clustering algorithms.

Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis covers demographic insights, customer behavior, campaign effectiveness, purchase channels, and spending patterns. Visualizations are used to understand data distributions and relationships.

Customer Segmentation
KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering are employed for customer segmentation. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score. Clusters are visualized using t-SNE.

Results and Interpretation
KMeans clustering is chosen based on the Silhouette Score. Customer clusters provide insights into groups with similar behavior, guiding targeted marketing strategies.

Usage
Data Exploration: Explore the provided Jupyter Notebook for data loading, cleaning, and initial analysis.
Customer Segmentation: Examine clusters obtained through KMeans clustering.
Campaign Analysis: Analyze campaign effectiveness for each customer cluster.
Visualization: Gain insights into customer behavior using visualizations.
Machine Learning: Utilize clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques for segmentation.
